# cost_of_living_and_crime
Comparison of cost of living and the crime statistics throughout the contiguous United States.

## Executive Summary
Look at crime statistics across the continental US over several years in comparison to 
changes in the costs of basic goods and necessities. I wanted to see if changes in 
essentials such as gas or groceries affected the rate of petty crime and if there were any 
trends in larger offenses as well.
## Motivation
I wanted to work with crime data because I currently work with a police department 
and wanted to see the extent of their effect. On top of that the recent economic 
downturn had me wondering if we would see an increase in crimes.
## Data Question
Does harder times increase the rate of crime? What crimes are affected and by how 
much in terms of an economic boom or recession?
## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
I hope to have crime statistics across years for comparison and link that to a table of 
cost of goods across years. From there I would create bar charts for the most prevalent 
crimes and line charts to compare the economy to the crime stats over time. I was 
hoping to aggregate these into a presentable tableau presentation, where I would be 
able to articulate the findings.
